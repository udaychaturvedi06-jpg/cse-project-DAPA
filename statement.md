# DAPA Project Statement


Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a simple, lightweight academic assistance system that helps students understand how their marks add up across assignments, attendance, mid-semester tests, and final exams. Most students struggle to predict their final grades or calculate CGPA on their own. DAPA solves this by giving one clean place where students can add their course details, enter their marks, and instantly see their academic standing.
It is designed to remove confusion, make academic planning easier, and help students take better control of their performance. The entire system is built using basic Python and simple data handling—making it easy to learn from and extend further.

Scope of the Project

This project focuses on the core academic management features required by every bachelor student.
The scope includes:

. Adding and storing course information

. Entering internal assessment marks, mid and final scores

. Automatically converting raw marks to weighted totals

. Predicting GPA and CGPA

. Running “what-if” simulations to see how marks can improve

. Generating a simple study plan based on difficulty and performance shortage

. Course analysis summary

. Exporting results for documentation

The project intentionally stays CLI-based to keep it portable, simple, and usable on any machine without any graphical requirements. It does not include GUI, database support, or online sync features since the aim is to keep the project student-friendly and easy to run anywhere.

Target Users

. DAPA is designed mainly for:

. College students who want clarity about their academic performance

. Students who want to predict CGPA and plan studies

. Beginners learning Python who want to understand how modular projects work

. Teachers who want to demonstrate academic evaluation logic

. Anyone who needs a simple offline tool without complex setup
